# Project Name: Attendance Tracking System


## Project Description
Python application that automatically scans attendance with a laser scanner, separates data for colleges, and sends it to the appropriate emails with date, time, and training info. Program set up in Docker on Linux. Key skills: Python, Docker, Kali Linux.

## Problem Statement 
Students attend classes and record their attendance on the designated portal. Despite this effort, they often face the inconvenience of having to manually log in just to check their attendance status, since the portal does not provide automatic updates or notifications.

Unfortunately, technical difficulties sometimes cause attendance records to be inaccurate, leaving students uncertain of their attendance status. Also, the manual process of separating data and providing it to the appropriate colleges can be inefficient and error-prone. Some students may even have attendance recorded as absent, despite being present.

Furthermore, there is a lack of organization when it comes to recording data for new programs or events, leading to inconsistencies and confusion in attendance tracking.

To address these issues, we have improved and upgraded the system. It now provides automatic updates and notifications, reduces the manual process, and ensures accurate tracking of attendance records for all programs and events.

## Scope of the project
The project will focus on the development of an attendance tracking system for students at a college. The system will automate the process of tracking and reporting attendance, and will include a user interface for trainers to monitor attendance and view attendance data


## Project Overview
The text appears to be grammatically correct. Here's a suggestion for improvement:

Keeping track of student attendance is critical for educational institutions in today's fast-paced world. While technology has made it easier to maintain attendance records digitally, notifying students about their attendance can still be challenging. Our desktop application, developed using Tkinter in Python, offers a solution to this problem.

The application allows trainers to take attendance using an RFID reader, and when a student taps their RFID card, the attendance information is stored in an Excel sheet on the local system. The sheet also contains students' email addresses, and the application sends an email notifying each student of their attendance status in their training sessions.

Our application offers an important feature of adding or removing events, which allows users to manage their schedules efficiently. With this feature, users can quickly create new attendance sheets and take attendance of students attending the event. The ability to remove events also allows users to eliminate unnecessary data from their application.

To facilitate easy installation and maintenance, we have deployed the application in Docker. Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications along with their dependencies into a single container, enabling developers to deploy the application on any platform without worrying about compatibility issues.
